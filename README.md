C# WPF-Player, which contains all default options and Ads

This is WPF-Player
Which contains all default player options and Ads.
If u want to remove Ads just delete "reklama()" function and same Class.

❗❗❗For correctly work you should add some .mp4 file in Player/bin/Debug/vid/ with name: "def.mp4"


In this project I used: 
1) MaterialDesign: http://materialdesigninxaml.net
2) TagLib-sharp: https://www.nuget.org/packages/TagLibSharp

Also there are some .mp3 and .mp4 files from diffirent sources.
